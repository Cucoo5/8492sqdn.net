Recommended Specs Storage You MUST install DCS on an SSD (solid state) instead of an HDD (spinning disk). The base game is 160GB and a large install is 700GB+. A dedicated 1TB or larger high performance SSD is recommended.
Tom&amp;rsquo;s Hardware: Best SSDs
An SSD is absolutely essential. When installed on a spinning disk, DCS can take over 20 minutes to load into a mission and may crash during loading or during gameplay.</description>
